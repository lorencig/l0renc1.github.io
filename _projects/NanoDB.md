## ✨ Key Features

1. **Intuitive User Interface**:
   - Our example contains four main tabs guide users through the data collection process, **but all the tabs, frames and entries can be easily changed**:
     - **Intro**: Enter basic information about the sample, create new entry or call old sample data throught the search bar. All entries will appear in the listbox. Type of entries used: Combobox, Comment, Date, Simple Entry.
     - **Synthesis**: Type of entries used: Combobox, Simple Entry, dynamic entries based on selected values.
     - **Characterization**: Type of entries used: Combobox, Spinbox, Simple Entry, dynamic entries based on selected values.
     - **Save & Export**: Save the data to the local DB, generate report in PDF and zip images renamed after the sample name.

2. **Dynamic Data Fields**:
   - The form fields are adaptive based on user input, offering a customized experience that evolves as different data is input across the tabs.

3. **Data Persistence**:
   - All data is saved locally in an Excel file, ensuring offline access and secure data management.

4. **Easy Data Retrieval**:
   - Users can recall previous entries, modify them, or add new data to existing records.

5. **PDF Report Generation**:
   - Quickly generate comprehensive PDF reports of your experiments.

6. **Image Management**:
   - Attach and manage images related to your experiments directly from the app.

7. **Data Export**:
   - Export the experimental data in various formats, ensuring compatibility with external tools.

## 🛠️ Code Structure aka Documentation

## 📂 Files

- **`main.py`**: The core script for running the app.
- **`README.md`**: Documentation and instructions.
- **`/images`**: Directory containing assets such as images or logos used within the app.
- **`/screenshots`**: Directory containing screenshots of what the application should look like while running.
- **`registration_data.xlsx`**: The excel file where all the data will be stored. Keeping the file open while writing new data or opening the app, may cause problems. Recommended to keep it close while operating.
- **`main.spec`**: Ready for use if executable is inteded to be created using Pyinstaller library.
- **`requirements.txt`**: List of libraries to be installed prior of launching the app.
- **`intro_tab.py`**: The first tab of the app, containing the logo, date type of entry, comment type of entry, combobox type of entry and simple text entry. Also the search bar based on the sample name.
- **`synthesis_tab.py`**: The second tab of the app, containing generally combobox and simple text type of entry.
- **`characterization_tab.py`**: The third tab of the app, containing generally spinbox, combobox and simple text type of entry.
- **`save_export_tab.py`**: The last tab of the app, containing the functions to write/edit the entry on the DB, generate the PDF containing also images (optional), compressing images saving it with the Sample name prefix, restart the app to ensure a clean insertion of a new entry.
