# Low-cost tickets to escape from your discomfort triggers

### i) Baseline of facts/stats
According to the United Nations Tourism Barometer1
“_International arrivals (overnight visitors) reached 97% of 2019 levels in the first quarter of 2024, reflecting an almost complete recovery of pre-pandemic numbers._”
“_An estimated 285 million tourists traveled internationally in the first three months of 2024, about 20% more than in the same period of 2023._”


## 1.	What is an experience?
As is always the case with common simple words, their explanation is often vague and interpreted differently by different schools of thought. Experience, as a word, is abused while used in many contexts that are far from being experienced. 
According to **Socrates** (Book I, Part I)
“_With a view to action experience seems in no respect inferior to art, and men of experience succeed even better than those who have theory without experience. The reason is that experience is knowledge of individuals, art of universals, and actions and productions are all concerned with the individual._”
As for Socrates, the experience is the reality check of the theory, or in the inverse, it may also serve as the building blocks of the theory itself.
According to John **Locke**, Empiricist, (An Essay Concerning Human Understanding, Book I)
“_So, at birth, the human mind is a sort of blank slate on which experience writes._” (tabula rasa)
Later claiming that experience is a multilayered action involving senses, perception, and reflection, the latest crucial moment of understanding the knowledge of the experience itself and absorbing it.
From many other relevant quotations and definitions, the basis and the common ground of each is to consider experience the active reflection on the perceived or sensed action.


### a)	How to experience an experience?
To consider an “experience” as an experience, we should be involved in many directions after sensing or perceiving the act or action. Per definition we should reflect, said in this way, may sound limited. A reflection that is followed by a directional change of the events, a self-reflection of past actions in light of the new point of view or modification of inner beliefs, moral or ethical reflections of self or others, creative or critical thinking, learning, studying, problem-solving, language use, appreciation or mindfulness, all those are a non-exhaustive list of what it can consider as reflection and making the “experience” an experience.

### b)	Superficial Experiences
Superficial experiences are those that are perceived through simple sensory experiences such as eating, drinking, watching, passive listening, having sex, using drugs, etc. All those actions may be considered passive, and contrary to the self-definition of an experience, we can say that superficial experiences are not merely experiences but straightforward activities that do not encompass any increase in knowledge or emotions by doing them. 

## 2.	Traveling
By travel, we intend to move physically from the traditional living place to a new area, considerably far from the so-called, home. By travel we also consider breaking the daily routine and by logic, also the habits. Travel generally means not working, or, as it is said plainly, less responsibility. The detachment from everyday obligations gives a sense of temporary freedom. Depending on the type of travel, it may also involve immersion in new cultures, languages, social interactions, and physical locations which can broaden one's worldview and offer fresh perspectives.

## 3.	Outcome of Traveling
Measurable outcomes are photos and souvenirs. Their relation to memories and experience.

## 4.	Socials, the marketing of the hidden product
Marketing works. Nothing new. Socials are one of the biggest markets for promoting every type of product or service. 
Fact check “According to World Advertising Research Center Media, social media is the largest media channel worldwide by advertising investment, with Meta alone representing a 63% share of global social spend.”2
Travel per se or specific trending locations do not distinguish it from other types of products. From the personal perspective of a generally bad social user like myself, I consider a huge contribution from most the user, to document their travels very well. All this can be a self-generated marketing campaign and, to some extent have a measurable effect on the hype of travel.
By logical deduction, socials are a great marketing source, socials have a considerably huge platform of hosting users, so, socials have a considerable effect in selling travel as a concept or a specific destination. Of course, you are not the case babe!  
•	What’s the effect of marketing on the hypothetical-user behavior? 
•	What was the story of the campaign that they bought it? 
As in each other product, they buy the product not for their own sake, but to fill the need, the desire, to solve the problem. All the previous converge in the story of experiencing pleasure through this movement.
